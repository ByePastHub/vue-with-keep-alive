<table class="table table-bordered table-striped table-condensed">
  <tr>
    <td>mode (String)</td>
	  <td>Mode: all caches (default) allKeepAlive, custom cache component customizeKeepAlive needs to be set in the route settings meta: { keepAlive: true }</td>

  <tr>

	  <td>Maximum number of pages to cache (default: 5)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>exclude  (Array | String)</td>
	  <td>String or regular expression. Any component whose name matches will not be cached</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>matchClearList (Array)</td>
	  <td>When a name is matched, except the name of the current page, clear other page names</td>

## router Object

- `push/replace/forward`: Cache jump page component

- `replace`: Similar to push, the only difference is that it does not add new records to history

- `reLaunch`: Clear all cached components when jumping, and then cache the page component again

- Others (including system return) are all backwards, and the page component will be destroyed when the route changes.

- In the above router object, add the `destroy` property (String|Array) to customize the page component that has been destroyed by the cache.
::: tip
`reLaunch`: Jump is the same as `replace`, it will not add new records to history, if you need to use other jump methods, you can use the above methods, such as
```js
this.$router.push({name: 'Home', destroy: 'ALL'})
```
